Personal project.

#### Context

{:.fade}
Tired of using Bootstrap and other heavy CSS frameworks, and reusing a lot of components at my job, I decided to create my own SCSS framework to save time. The idea of Fajny (pronounce /ˈfaj.nɨ/, meaning cool in Polish) was to make a light weight, complete, easy to use and personalise SCSS framework. It is of course responsive, and since it does not use JavaScript it’s compatible with most of modern frameworks.
