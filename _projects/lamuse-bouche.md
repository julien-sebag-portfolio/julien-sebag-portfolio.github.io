Internship as a designer for 4 months and freelance designer for 6 months.

{:.fade}
#### Context

{:.fade}
The restaurant Lâ€™Amuse Bouche, specialized in "rapid gastronomy", needs to increase its recognition in Lyon to expand its activity. They call a group of students to create a new communication strategy. This partnership has been continued for an operational framework. At the the end of the internship, I was called for freelancing missions to set up new actions.
